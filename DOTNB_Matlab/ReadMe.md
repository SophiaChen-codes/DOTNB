DOTNB_Matlab includes the Matlab Code function files to calculate the PDF, CDF, mean, variance and simulation for the variable generated from 
the Difference Of Two Negative Binomial of DOTNB distribution (DOTNB).
PDF: Probability Density Function
CDF: Cumulative Density Function

Here is a test example to simulate 30000 numbers following DOTNB distribution, and calculate the theoretical distribution. Then pLot the histgraph of simulated numbers and the theoretical pdf function.
