# DOTNB distribution: the Difference Of Two Negative Binomial distributions.
The DOTNB repository is a collection of code files that implement DOTNB across several programming languages.  
The DOTNB is a distribution for Difference Of Two Negative Binomial distributions, NB(r1,p1) and NB(r2,p2).  
We hope these code files can help users to implement DOTNB in their own models/methods.    

Please note that a more robust implementation in R is availble for NGS data analysis at: 
https://github.com/chenyongrowan/DEGage.git

# Citation
If you use the code and/or the DOTNB distribution, please cite the following paper:

Petrany A., Zhang S. and Chen, Y. A General Probabilistic Model for Comparative Analysis of Next-generation Sequencing data. Under Review.

# Download
## Github
Run the following code in a terminal to retreive the DOTNB files, or download the file containing functions in your desired language.
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/chenyongrowan/DOTNB.git
  ```

# Requirements
Requirements differ between language. See the README files under each language for more details.


## Instructions

In the folder of each language, the mean, variance, CDF, and PDF functions of DOTNB are provided.
