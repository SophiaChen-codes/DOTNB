# DOTNB distribution: the Difference Of Two Negative Binomial distributions.
The DOTNB repository is a collection of code files for multiple programming languages.
The DOTNB is a distribution for Difference Of Two Negative Binomial distributions, NB(r1,p1) and NB(r2,p2).
We hope these code files can help users to use DOTNB in their own models/methods.

# Citation
If you use the code and DOTNB distribution, please cite the following paper:

Petrany A., Zhang S. and Chen, Y. DEGage: a General Model-based Method for Detecting Differentially Expressed Genes from scRNA-seq Data. To be submitted.
