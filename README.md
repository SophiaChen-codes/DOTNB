# DOTNB is a collection of code files for multiple programming languages.
The DOTNB is a distribution for Difference Of Two Negative Binomial, NB(r1,p1) and NB(r2,p2).
We hope these code files can help users to use DOTNB in their own models/methods.
If you use the code and DOTNB distribution, please cite the following paper:
