# DOTNB distribution: the Difference Of Two Negative Binomial distributions.
The DOTNB repository is a collection of code files that implement DOTNB across several programming languages.
The DOTNB is a distribution for Difference Of Two Negative Binomial distributions, NB(r1,p1) and NB(r2,p2).
We hope these code files can help users to implement DOTNB in their own models/methods.

# Citation
If you use the code and/or the DOTNB distribution, please cite the following paper:

Petrany A., Zhang S. and Chen, Y. A General Probabilistic Model for Comparative Analysis of Next-generation Sequencing data. Under Review.

# Download
## Github
Run the following code in a terminal to retreive the DOTNB files, or download the file containing functions in your desired language.
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/chenyongrowan/DOTNB.git
  ```

# Requirements
You can select the DOTNB package with you preferred programming language. The compiling and requirements details are following.


## Instructions

The DOTNB is performaed by several programming languages. In each folder, the functions of PDF, CDF, mean and variance are provided.

## Examples

In DOTNB_Matlab sudbfolder, examples are shown how use these functions.
